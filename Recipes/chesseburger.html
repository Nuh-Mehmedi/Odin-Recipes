    <h1>Chesse Burger</h1>
    <img src="../chesseburger.jpeg" alt="Chesseburger">
    <p>A cheeseburger is a savory, iconic American sandwich consisting of a seared, seasoned ground beef patty topped with melted cheese (typically American, cheddar, or Swiss) served inside a sliced, often toasted, bun. It is frequently customized with toppings like lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, and condiments such as ketchup, mustard, or mayo. .</p>
    <h2>Indigriends
        <ul >
           <li>Ground Beef.</li>
           <li>Cheese.</li>
           <li>Burger Bun.</li>
           <li>Tomato.</li>
           <li>Pickled Cucumbers.</li>
           <li>Lettuce</li>
           <li>Onion</li>
           <li>Ketchup.</li> 
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps
            <ol>
            <li>Divide the ground beef. Divide the ground beef into 4 or 6 portions, depending on the number of burgers you would like to make.</li>
            <li>Shape the patties. Gently press each portion of ground beef into a disk about 1-inch thick. Press the middle to create a shallow “dimple” and pat the edges into a round — the patty should look like a frisbee and be slightly larger than your burger buns.</li>
            <li>Warm the pan. Heat a pat of butter or a teaspoon of oil in a griddle or large skillet over medium heat..</li>
            <li>Toast the buns. Working in batches if needed, place the bun halves cut-side down in the warm butter or oil. Toast until the surface is golden-brown.</li>
            <li>Increase the heat to medium-high. Increase the heat to medium-high, and keep a careful eye on the pan. When you see the first wisp of smoke, you’re ready to cook the burgers.</li>
            <li>Cook the burgers. Place the burger patties in the hot pan, leaving a little space between each one. Work in batches if necessary. Generously season with salt and pepper, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Flip the burgers. Quickly slide a spatula under the burgers and flip to the other side. Season the other side generously with salt and pepper, and cook for another 3 to 5 minutes to your preferred doneness.</li>
            <li>To make cheeseburgers. If making cheeseburgers, top the burgers with cheese as soon as you flip them. If the cheese isn’t melting fast enough, cover the pan with a lid or other dome to encourage the cheese to melt.</li>
            <li>Finish the burgers. When the burgers have finished cooking, transfer them to the toasted buns and finish with your favorite burger toppings.</li>
